# Set-Mood- DApp
This is a simple Decentralized application I made.

Firstly You need to run lite-server after that on the localhost:3000 you will see a interface like this -

Then you need to connect your metamask wallet and then select the Ropsten Test Network then in the web page you need to type your current mood and then click on the button setMood
then you need to allow the transaction to proceed and then when you will click on getMood you will the same string(mood) will be logged inside your console.
